# Overview:
Welcome to the project repository for "Integrating Explainability into Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Navigation in Simulated Environments." This project focuses on enhancing the explainability of reinforcement learning models used for autonomous vehicle navigation in simulated environments.

# Environment:
The simulated environment used in this project is the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym.

# Algorithms:
The repository contains implementations of three reinforcement learning algorithms: DQN, A2C, and PPO. Each algorithm is trained in the Lunar Lander environment, and the best-trained models are saved in the corresponding algorithm training folders. Future research efforts can leverage these pre-trained models without the need for retraining.

# Explainability:
To enhance the explainability of the reinforcement learning models, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm is utilized. The implementations of this algorithm for all trained models are available in the explainability folder.
